# SPOJ-solutions
As the name suggests this repo contains the solution of the spoj coded by nickzuck_007 (SPOJ & CODECHEF User Id )

<B> How can I find the solution to problems</b><br/>
You can find the solutions to the problems by the problem code <br/>
<br/>
<B>Is this repository flawed</B><br/>
Not really ! But technically , yes it is <br/>
You may find that there are the solutions with the problem code that do not exist...I'm sorry for that but thats a funny story<br/>
First let me tell you that if you find some code of that form..They may be useless to you because they are not the AC solutions ...Time for Story now <br/>
Before I know Git which is a Distributed VCS , i was using my file as a Local VCS...I think that's enough to explain this shit<br/>
So if you find some of those problems you may reverse the name of the file to get the exact problems link (But that's worthless)
<br/><br/>

<B>COPYRIGHTS</B><br/>
If you like to use the code for your submissions, you may use them ... I don't give a fuck about it...But I must not be held responsible to the harm caused to you<br/>
